## Overview:


The dataset comprises detailed listings of 4,801 properties for sale in New York, covering a range of condos, houses, and townhouses across 17 distinct columns of information. It includes data on the listing broker, property type, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and precise geographic locations from Manhattan to Staten Island. Prices vary widely, with listings such as a condo priced at $195,000,000, showcasing the diversity of New York's real estate market.

Geographic details extend to latitude and longitude, offering in-depth insights for market analysis. This extensive dataset serves as a valuable tool for buyers, investors, and analysts, providing a comprehensive view of the housing landscape in New York.

## Dataset:

Dataset Size:  1.33 MB, 4801 rows with 17 distinct columns.


#### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/new-york-housing-market

## Reasearch Questions:

-  What factors most significantly impact house prices in New York?
-  Can we accurately predict the price of a house based on its characteristics/features?

## Proposed Outcome:

Leveraging this dataset,I would like to build models and conduct an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), to predict property prices, and use, other features like its characteristics and location.

Target Column :- Price Column (Analyze the distribution of house prices to understand market trends.)
